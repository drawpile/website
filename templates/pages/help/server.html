# Dedicated server

The client application has a builtin server for quickly hosting drawing sessions,
but a dedicated server is also included. The dedicated server has the following extra features:

* Headless mode for server boxes (with remote administration API)
* Can serve multiple sessions simultaneously
* Sessions that do not terminate when last user leaves
* File backed sessions that survive server restarts and crashes
* SSL support
* User accounts
* More configuration options

Typical use cases where the dedicated server works better than the built-in one:

* Home network is behind a NAT firewall, but you have access to a virtual server
* A public or private server for a group of users
* Hosting long running sessions

## Installing the server (on Linux)

The easiest way to install the server is to download the AppImage.
The server will not run as root, so it's a good idea to create a new username just for it.
Copy the AppImage onto the server and give it execute permissions (`chmod a+x Drawpile-srv-2.0.0.AppImage`)

You can then simply run the AppImage to start the server with default settings:
`./Drawpile-srv-2.0.0.AppImage`. (Although in practice, you most likely want to use a configuration file or database. See more below.)

Tip: make a symlink (`ln -s Drawpile-srv-2.0.0.AppImage drawpile-srv`) to always refer to the latest version.

Note that when using the AppImage version, the working directory is inside the
image so relative paths in command line arguments will not work as you expect.
So instead of `-c config.cfg`, use `-c /home/user/config.cfg`


## Compatibility

Server version 1.0.6 is compatible with all 1.x.x series clients.

The 2.x series servers are compatible with all 2.x.x series clients,
with the caveat that features introduced in newer servers may not be accessible from older clients.

Run `drawpile-srv --version` to see the protocol version number of the server.
See the [compatibility chart](/help/compatibility/) for details.

## Graphical mode

When the application is started with no command line options, or explicitly
with the option `--gui`, it will run in graphical mode. The GUI makes it easy
to manage a server that is running on a desktop computer and also works
as a remote management tool for headless servers.


## Starting from the command line

Run `drawpile-srv -h` to get a list of supported command line parameters.
The most commonly used ones are:

 * `--port <port>` selects the port on which the server will listen
 * `--listen <address>` restricts the server to listening on just the specified address
 * `--local-host <address>` set the hostname of the server to use in announcements
 * `--ssl-cert <file>` and `--ssl-key <file>` set the SSL certificate and key files to use
 * `--record <path>` set session recording path
 * `--web-admin-port <port>` set the remote admin API port (enables remote admin, see more below)
 * `--config <file>` use a configuration file
 * `--database <file>` use a configuration database
 * `--sessions <path>` directory to store sessions in (see more below)
 * `--templates <path>` where to look for session templates (see more below)

Simply running `drawpile-srv` will start the server with reasonable defaults. However,
using a configuration file or database is highly recommended.


## Configuration file and database

There are two options for storing server configuration:
a plaintext configuration file and an SQLite database.

When using the configuration file, the settings can only be changed by
changing the file directly (the server reloads the file automatically.)
If you want to use the remote admin API, you should choose the
configuration database.

The configuration file uses a simple INI style format.

Example:

    [config]
	sessionSizeLimit = 15MB
	sessionCountLimit = 25
    idleTimeLimit = 3h
	title = Welcome to my test server!
	announceWhiteList = true

	[announceWhitelist]
	https://drawpile.net/api/sessions/

	[ipbans]
	192.168.1.1
	10.0.0.1/16

	[users]
	moderator:plain;qwerty123:MOD,HOST

### [config] section

The following settings can be set here:

 * `clientTimeout=60s` - connection timeout for clients
 * `sessionSizeLimit=15mb` - size limit for session history. Set to zero to allow sessions of unlimited size.
 * `sessionCountLimit=25` - maximum number of simultaneous sessions.
 * `persistence=false` - allow sessions to exist without any logged in users
 * `idleTimeLimit=0` - if larger than zero, sessions where nothing happens for this time are terminated
 * `serverTitle` - title shown in the login dialog
 * `welcomeMessage` - message sent to users who have just logged in
 * `announceWhitelist=false` - use the announcement server whitelist.
 * `privateUserList=false` - if set to true, list of logged in users is not included in session announcements
 * `allowGuests=true` - allow unauthenticated users
 * `allowGuestHosts=true` - if set to false, only authenticated users with the `HOST` flag can create new sessions
 * `archiveMode=false` - when using file backed sessions, rename session file to `oldname.archived` instead of deleting it on termination
 * `extauth=false` - enable external authentication (you must also set the server URL with  the `--extauth` command line parameter`
 * `extauthkey=key string` - external authentication token validation key
 * `extauthgroup=group name` - external authentication user group (default is no group)
 * `extauthfallback=true` - permit guest logins when ext-auth server is not reachable
 * `extauthmod=true` - respect ext-auth user's MOD flag
 * `reporttoken=token` - authentication token for abuse report server (you must also set the `--report-url` command line parameter)

See [serverconfig.h](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/blob/master/src/shared/server/serverconfig.h) for the up to date list of supported settings.

### [announceWhiteList] section

In this section you can list the acceptable announcement server URLs. Remember to also add `announceWhitelist=true`
to the `[config]` section as well!

Tip: Leaving this section empty but setting `announceWhitelist` to `true` will disable session announcements entirely.

### [ipbans] section

In this section you can list the IP addresses and subnets that are banned from the server.
Both IPv4 and IPv6 style addresses are supported.

Note: Write the IP in the form it appears in the server log.

### [users] section

In this section you can list registered user accounts.
The syntax is `username:password:FLAGS`

Currently, the following password formats are supported:

 * plaintext: `plain;my password here`
 * Salted SHA1: `s+sha1;salt;hash`, where `salt` and `hash` are hex encoded bytestrings and `hash` is SHA1(salt+hash)

Prefixing the password field with `*`will mark the username as banned. E.g. `admin:*plain;abc123;MOD`

Supported user flags are:

 * MOD - user is a moderator (can enter locked and password protected sessions and has permanent OP status)
 * HOST - may host sessions when `allowGuestHosts` is set to `false`

See also *external authentication* for an alternative way to have user accounts.

### Database

The configuration database is similar to the configuration file, but each section is a table
in an SQLite database. It can be edited manually with the `sqlite3` command, but its real
strength is that it can be easily modified by scripts and the server itself at runtime.

The database contains the following tables:

 * settings (equivalent to the `[config]` section)
 * listingservers
 * ipbans
 * users
 * serverlog

When started in graphical mode, the server always uses a configuration database.
The location of the database depends on the operating system:

 * Linux: `~/.local/share/drawpile/drawpile-srv/guiserver.db` (or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/drawpile/drawpile-srv/guiserver.db`)
 * Windows: `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\drawpile-srv\guiserver.db`
 * macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/drawpile-srv/guiserver.db`

## TLS

The dedicated server supports TLS encrypted connections.

Currently, Drawpile is optimized for use with self signed certificates.
The client does not verify that the cert has been signed by a Certificate Authority.
Instead, on first access the server's certificate is saved.
 If the certificate changes later, the client alerts the user. (The same way SSH works.)

A certificate can be generated with OpenSSL:

    $ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 

Enter your hostname as the Common Name.
(Note: when using an IP address rather than a hostname, Drawpile will not check the CN.)

The key.pem file must be kept private.
The cert.pem file contains the public certificate which is used to authenticate the server identity:

    $ drawpile-srv --ssl-cert cert.pem --ssl-key key.pem

You can additionally use the `--secure` flag to disallow unencrypted connections.

## Using Docker

An easy way to run the server is to use Docker. Try it out:

    $ docker run -it --rm -p 27750:27750 callaa/drawpile-srv

This will download the server image from docker hub and run the server. The `-p 27750:27750` argument
publishes the default drawpile port from the container so clients can connect to it.

A more realistic example:

    $ docker run -dt --name "drawpile-server" \
        -p 27750:27750 -p 127.0.0.1:27780:27780 \
        -v dpsessions:/home/drawpile \
        --restart always \
        callaa/drawpile-srv:2.1 --sessions /home/drawpile/sessions \
        --database /home/drawpile/config.db \
        --web-admin-port 27780 --web-admin-access all

The above does the following things:

 * Creates a container named `drawpile-server` from the `drawpile-srv:2.1` image pulled from Docker Hub and runs it in the background
 * Publishes port 27750 on all network interfaces and 27780 (the admin API) on loopback only
 * Mounts the named volume `dpsessions` at `/home/drawpile` inside the container. This allows hibernated sessions to live through container restarts
 * Automatically restarts the container if if shuts down
 * Enables file backed sessions, database configuration and web admin API
 * The web admin API is limited to connections from localhost by publishing it only to 127.0.0.1. Inside the container, the `all` access mode must be used.


## Using systemd

Drawpile server can be started in two ways using systemd.
The server can be started directly with `systemctl start drawpile-srv` or
by socket activation using `systemctl start drawpile-srv.socket`.
When socket activation is used, the server is started on-demand when the first client connects.
Note that when using SA, the `--port` and `--listen` parameters are ignored.
The listening address is configured in the `drawpile-srv.socket` unit file.

Use `systemctl enable drawpile-srv` or `systemctl enable drawpile-srv.socket` to automatically start the server on boot.

The current server AppImage does not have systemd support compiled in, so it does not support socket activation. Here is a sample
unit file that works with it (place in `/etc/systemd/system/drawpile-srv.service`):

    [Unit]
    Description=Drawpile dedicated server
    After=network.target
    Documentation=man:drawpile-srv
    
    [Service]
    ExecStart=/home/my_server/drawpile-srv -d /home/my_server/settings.db
    Type=simple
    Restart=always
    User=my_server
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target

Replace `my_server` with the username you will run the server as.
Best practice is to create a user just for running the server.
Note that for security reasons, the server will not run as root!

## Persistent sessions

A session is normally deleted after the last user logs out.
When the `persistence` configuration setting is set to `true`, sessions are allowed
to continue even after the last user has left. Persistence must also be enabled by
the user hosting the session.

To prevent old sessions from piling up, it is a good idea to set an idle time limit.
Setting this option will cause sessions that have been idle for more than the allowed
time to automatically terminate. (Note that this applies to sessions with users still in them
as well, if no-one is drawing anything or even chatting.)

It is generally a good idea to use file backed sessions when persistence is enabled,
as it allows the sessions to survive a server restart and frees up memory when
no one is logged in.

## Session recording

If a recording path is set, the server will make a recording of every session.
For example: `drawpile-srv --record ~/sessions/%a.dprec` will save each session
in the ´sessions` directory under the user's home directory.

The following placeholders can be used in the recording path:

 * `%d` - current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
 * `%h` - current time (HH.MM.SS)
 * `%i` - session ID
 * `%a` - session Alias (or ID if alias is not set)

If a file with the same name already exists, a number is added to the end of the name.
A new recording is started every time the session is reset.

Tip: when using file backed sessions, enabling archive mode has the same effect as recording
sessions.

## File backed sessions

When a session directory (`--sessions` or equivalent from the GUI settings dialog) is set,
sessions will be stored in files instead of just kept in memory. This allows sessions to
survive server restarts and crashes. It also saves some memory, since only parts immediately
needed have to be kept in RAM.

When the server is shut down, active sessions are not deleted automatically, even if not
marked as persistent.

A session on disk consists of two or more files:

 * `id.session` - session metadata
 * `id (x).dprec` - session history

A new `dprec` is created each time the session is reset. If archive mode is enabled,
session files are never deleted. Instead, `.archived` is added to the end of the filename
when a session is terminated. This is a more efficient alternative to recording sessions.

## Session templates

Session templates allow you to provide default sessions that always exist on the server.
Templates are looked for in the directory specified by the `--templates` command line parameter.

Template files are session recordings (`.dprec`) or hand written `.dptxt` files. For example:

    # Create a 3200x3200 canvas and two layers
    !version=dp:4.20.1
    !title=Template Session Demo
    !founder=Admin
    !password=plain;qwerty123
    
    0 owner users=1
    # Note: the owner command is needed to grant rights to these commands below.
    # The server will append the up to date owner list automatically.
    1 resize right=3200 bottom=3200
    1 newlayer id=0x0101 fill=#ffffff title=Background
    1 newlayer id=0x0102 title=Foreground

The following header metadata attributes can be used:

 * `version` - protocol version (default=server's version)
 * `title` - session title
 * `founder` - name of the user who created the session
 * `nsfm` - content not suitable for minors (default=false)
 * `preserveChat` - include chat in session history (default=false)
 * `persistent` - persistent session (default=false)
 * `maxUsers` - maximum number of simultaneous users (default=25)
 * `password` - password hash
 * `opword` - opword hash
 * `announce` - announce the session at this URL

Note: when using a `dptxt` template, the first two numbers in the server's protocol version
must match those in the `version` header.
For binary `dprec` templates, it's enough that the first number matches.

The name of the template file will be used as the session alias.
Sessions created from the template still get unique IDs, but share the same alias.

Tip: The `dprectool` utility can convert a binary recording to the text format and vice versa.

<h2 id="external-authentication">External authentication</h2>

Ext-auth is a user authentication mechanism that delegates the actual authentication to
an external server. It is an easy way to integrate Drawpile login with a a website's
existing user account system. With ext-auth, the user's password is never sent
to the Drawpile server, so it is usable by untrusted 3rd party servers.

To enable ext-auth, three settings must be set on the server side:

1. The ext auth server URL (set with `--extauth` command line argument)
2. The `extauth` setting must be set to `true`
3. The `extauthkey` setting must be set to the server's validation key

If guest logins are enabled, the server will query the ext-auth server for guest
login permission. If guest logins are disabled, this
step is skipped. By default, if guest logins are enabled but the auth server is
unreachable, guest login will be permitted for all usernames not on the server's
built-in user list. (The built-in user list always takes precedence over ext-auth
users.) If guest logins should not be permitted, set `extauthfallback` to `false`.

The ext-auth server URL is sent to the client, which prompts the user for a password.
The password is then sent to the ext-auth server which will return a signed login token.
The client sends the login token back to the Drawpile server, which checks it using
the ext-auth validation key.

To enable logins using drawpile.net accounts on your server, use these settings:

 * `--extauth https://drawpile.net/api/ext-auth/`
 * `extauthkey = 9eJ2tMJlqgSqHOIK/GI/qzS14WqIxHeB1Im5Hs/CCCk=`

If you wish to implement your own authentication server, refer to the [ext-auth wiki page](https://github.com/drawpile/Drawpile/wiki/External-authentication)

## Remote admin

The server provides a RESTful HTTP API for remote administration. It is enabled by
setting the HTTP server port: `--web-admin-port 8080`.
By default, only connections from localhost are accepted and no authentication is needed.

Use `--web-admin-access` to grant access to the wider network and `--web-admin-auth` to set the
HTTP BASIC Auth username/password pair.

However, directly exposing the server's admin API to the Internet is not recommended. A better
way is to put a reverse proxy, such as nginx, in between and have it handle the authentication.

Example nginx configuration:

    location /serveradmin/ {
	    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/;
		proxy_redirect default;
		auth_basic "Server Administration";
		auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/passwords;
	}

This way, the reverse proxy provides a layer of security against possible exploits against
the server.

The GUI frontend can act as a remote administration tool by starting it with command line
arguments `drawpile-srv --gui --remote APIURL` or by right clicking on the status tray icon.
