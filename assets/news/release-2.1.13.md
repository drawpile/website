Version 2.1.13 is now out. This is a bugfix release that fixes some regressions introduced in the previous version.

**Bugs fixed:**

 * Spacebar would have to be pressed again after releasing the mouse/stylus button when dragging
 * Brush color is now initialized properly on fresh install.
 * Eraser now works again without having to explicitly select a color
 * Brush blending mode is saved correctly again
 * Disabled brush preset drag&drop reordering. (Temporary bandaid solution to a regression. Will be fixed properly in the next release.)

**Other changes:**

 * Replaced pressure checkboxes with toggle buttons to free up some vertical space
 * Removed arbitrary OpenRaster image size limit
 * Enabled High-DPI icons and scaling (crisp toolbar buttons on Retina displays!)
