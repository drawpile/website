Version 2.0.2 is now out. This release fixes the bug that would lock up the application
when a session was reset, and many other bugs. It also adds a new logo contributed by
Leandro Pacheco. In many ways, this is the release [version 2.0.0](/news/release-2.0.0)
should have been.

Changes in this version include:

 * Fixed returning from fullscreen mode to maximized window
 * Fixed server crash when terminating an announced session
 * Restored missing "lock dock positions" feature
 * Messages received during reset while session history is full are now dropped (mitigates auto-reset loop of death)
 * Fixed layer selection after current layer is deleted
 * Separated layer delete & merge menu items
 * Various session template related fixes
 * Session history size is now displayed in the status bar
 * Fixed lockup on reset when navigator was visible
 * Reset no longer clears pinned chat message
 * Fixed "hide from self" layer menu item
 * Fixed selection moving when selection is partially (or completely) outside the canvas
 * Fixed Windows XP and Vista compatibility (32 bit version)

### Errata

Known bugs that are fixed in the next release:

 * Application can crash when merging layers. Workaround: avoid merging layers.
 * Strokes disappear on a newly created layer (after deleting a layer.) Workaround: lock and unlock the layer.
 * Canvas disappears after a reset. Workaround: disable automatic resets. In some cases, a *redo* by the user who performed the reset may also fix the canvas.
 * Only one template session is shown in the join dialog. No workaround, but the hidden sessions can still be joined with their full URLs (drawpile://server/templatename)
