In preparation for some changes to the web site, I'm doing a little end of the year cleanup.

First, the **Gallery** section is going away. New submissions are disabled and the entire section
will be deleted sometime in the future. **In its place**, a new Community (name pending) section will be added.
The community page will be a place to list your own communities, the server(s) it uses, community specific terms
of service, moderator contacts, etc.

Second, unused user accounts will be removed. Any account that hasn't been used in the past year will be automatically deleted, freeing up the usernames for re-registration.
