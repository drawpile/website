About 9 months ago, I (that is, the main Drawpile developer) revived the project after a much too long hiatus. Since then, development has been progressing steadily and the official 1.0 release is on the horizon. In preparation for that event, I thought it was high time time to drag the web site to this decade as well.

The big changes—aside from the refreshed look—are the new domain (drawpile.net), a new easier to use download area and online documentation.

Most of the documentation is mirrored from the Drawpile GitHub Wiki. The Wiki is now updated as new features are developed, while the documentation on this site is kept up with the latest release version.
