Version 0.9.8 of Drawpile is now [available for download](/download/)!

The previous release, while fixing important bugs, also introduces a couple of nasty regressions.
Hopefully, I managed to squash them all for this release.

Important bugs fixed are:

 * Unnecessary retcon at start of new strokes (improves performance)
 * Fixed regression in annotation tool (annotation moving/resizing was broken in previous release)
 * Fixed retconning of indirect strokes

Feature enhancements include:

 * Menu bar is now shown when the cursor is brought to the top of the screen in full screen mode
 * UI language can now be selected explicitly via the settings dialog
 * Holding a tool shortcut key now switches to the tool temporarily. When the key is released, the old tool is restored.
 * A new "fill under" mode for the flood fill tool.
